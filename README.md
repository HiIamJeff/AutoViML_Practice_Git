# AutoViML_Practice_Git

## Description

This is an introduction and self-practice of a AutoML package called AutoViML. The repo includes the personal notebook that tries out the package and two used datasets. AutoViML is a pretty cool open-sourced package which does the AutoML and Auto Visualization really well. Here is the presentation of the package given by the developer (Mr. Ram Seshadri) at Kaggle NYC event. (https://youtu.be/SU8NYWZxgL4)

The datasets in used are:
- Boston Housing dataset https://www.kaggle.com/heptapod/uci-ml-datasets/data#
- Titanic datasets from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Please keep in mind that this package is still undergoing rapid update. I will update the notebook as much as I could. However, if you are interested in the latest thing, please look into the its official Github https://github.com/AutoViML/Auto_ViML.

Feel free to let me know any thought!
